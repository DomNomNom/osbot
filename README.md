A game-AI challenge

Required libraries:
  * pymunk
  * pyglet


To write an controller (AI) make a new script in game/controllers.
Have a look at base.py and stupid.py for more hints on how to make a controller.
To acutally see the controller in action add a blob with your controller name to game/resources/levels/default.txt. This may change.
